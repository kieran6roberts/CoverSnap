# CvrSnap

Every blog post needs to good cover article. CvrSnap empowers you to create great looking blog cover
images in seconds using templates and simple editing tools. It's completely free to download as many cover
images as you like.

I initially built this tool for myself because I needed quick and simple blog cover images for my own blog without
having to design them myself. I could spend hours trying different design ideas without sticking to something.

## Who is this tool for (other than me)?

This tool is for anyone who wants a quick blog post cover image that highlights their blog title in the cover image.
I don't care for a generic background image pulled from the Unsplash API. I just wanted some thing clean that included my
article title and name in the image. If that sounds like something you need, then this tool is for you.
