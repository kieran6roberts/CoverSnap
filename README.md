# CvrSnap

Every blog post needs to good cover image. CvrSnap empowers you to create great looking blog cover
images in seconds using templates and simple editing tools. It's completely free to download as many cover
images as you like.

I initially built this tool for myself because I wanted quick and simple blog cover images for my own blog, something that would be enjoyable to use. I didn't care for complex design and wanted to highlight my blog title/author name.

## Who is this tool for (other than me)?

- Someone who needs a simple good looking blog cover image with some text as the focus, usually for the blog title and author.

- You don't want to use a cover image taken from an internet image platform.

- You don't want to spend hours starting from sratch. You just want to pick some preset templates, maybe change some font settings etc.

- You want to do all of this in a modern and user-friendly editor.

- You can upload images to the cover background for something a little more custom if that's something that interests you.
